# Import additional configuration files.
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import,
# it will be replaced.
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with /, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with ~/.
# Also, import must be in the root level of the config file

# Idea: Create templates with env vars and use envsubst to create the real
# config files with the variables values.
